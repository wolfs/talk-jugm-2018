=== Maven vs. Gradle
image::incremental-build.png[background,size=70% 70%]

=== Gradle is up to 100 times faster than Maven

=== Gradle is up to 150 times faster than Maven

=== How

* Incremental compilation (Java)
* Incremental builds
* Compile avoidance (Java)
* Build cache

== Incremental compilation

* Only compile the files that changed
* and their dependencies...
* Language specific
* enabled by default since Gradle 4.10

=== In practice

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.commons.math3.complex.Complex;

public class Library {
    public Complex someLibraryMethod() {
        return Complex.I;
    }
}
----

* `Complex` is a dependency of `Library`
* if `Complex` is changed, we need to recompile `Library`
* if `ComplexUtils` is changed, no need to recompile

== Incremental builds

=== Why does it matter?

* Gradle is meant for incremental builds
* `clean` is a waste of time

[%notitle]
=== Task inputs/outputs
image::task_inputs_outputs.svg[width=380px, height=auto]

=== In practice

=== The _incrementality_ test

* Run a build
* Run again with no change
* If a task was re-executed, time is wasted
* Investigate!

=== Investigate

* https://e.grdev.net/s/wfn3yv5s4zihm/timeline?task=qgktl2jdzi6ja[Build scan]
* `--info`

== Compile avoidance

=== Compile classpath

What does a *compiler* care about?

[%step]
* Input: jars, or class directories
* Jar: class files
* Class file: both API and implementation

=== Compile classpath

What we provide to the compiler

[source,java]
----
public class Foo {
    private int x = 123;

    public int getX() { return x; }
    public int getSquaredX() { return x * x; }
}
----

=== Compile classpath

What the compiler cares about:

[source,java]
----
public class Foo {
    public int getX()
    public int getSquaredX()
}
----

=== Compile classpath

But it could also be

[source,java]
----
public class Foo {
    public int getSquaredX()
    public int getX()
}
----

**only public signatures matter**

=== Icing on the cake

* Upgrade a dependency from `1.0.1` to `1.0.2`
* If ABI hasn't changed, Gradle will _not_ recompile
* Even if the name of the jar is different (`mydep-1.0.1.jar` vs `mydep-1.0.2.jar`)
* Because only _contents_ matter

== Build cache

=== Incremental build

Gradle is reusing results +
from *last time*  +
when we ran *this build* +
 on *this machine*. +

=== Gradle can do better

=== Why not...

Reuse results +
from *anytime before*  +
when we ran *any build* +
 *anywhere*. +

=== In practice

=== In practice

=== The _cacheablility_ test

* First: _incrementality_ test
* `clean assemble`: all cacheable task from cache
* `clean assemble` in other location
* https://e.grdev.net/c/okf5lzs3mcu72/aezckc5xuhkk4/task-inputs?toggled=WzNd[Investigate!]

=== Build cache

* Stable for JVM, Android, C/C++ and Swift projects
* Gradle Enterprise provides a backend for managing, monitoring and replicating caches
* Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/gradle/build-cache-node/[gradle/build-cache-node]

== Measure and optimize

* Need data
** CI server captures times
** What about developer builds
** https://e.grdev.net/scans?list.offset=0&list.size=50&list.sortColumn=startTime&list.sortOrder=desc&search.buildOutcome=success&search.rootProjectName=gradle&search.startTimeMax=1537738791218&search.startTimeMin=1537133991218&search.tags=local&search.tasks=clean[Build scans!]

== Faster debugging

* https://e.grdev.net/s/cpzmbtjgfo7sk/console-log?task=:performance:k9AndroidBuild#L4[Build scans]

== High degree of automation

* Kotlin DSL
* Improved dependency management
* Composite builds
* Source dependencies

== Kotlin DSL

=== Motivation

=== Current* limitations

* DSL was not designed for performance
* Tooling friendlyness
* Reusing patterns and techniques from application development level

=== Design Constraints

* Preserve the use of 1500+ Gradle plugins
* No magic: be transparent to tooling and users
* Leverage idiomatic Kotlin
* Ease of migration

=== Features

* First-class IDE support
* Precompiled script plugins
* Build cache support for script compilation

=== Demo

=== Timeline

* 1.0 release with Gradle 5.0
* https://docs.gradle.org/nightly/userguide/build_cache.html#enable_caching_of_non_cacheable_tasks[User guide has been updated]

== Dependency management

=== Why dependency management?

=== Source vs published

* Sources
** (mostly) reliable
** (often) slow
** never touched
** hard to version
** safe

=== Source vs published (2)

* Binaries
** Stable
** Fast (pre-built)
** Requires trusted sources
** Not always metadata

=== Consuming binaries

* A `lib` directory
* From a Maven repository
** Maven Central (OSS libraries)
** Private repositories (closed source, proxies)
* From an Ivy repository
** Artifactory, ...
* From a custom repository
** JitPack, ...

=== Lib directory

* Straightforward
* No dependency management at all
* Binaries in SCM

=== Maven/Ivy repository

* GAV coordinates
* transitive dependencies management
* metadata format restricts what you can do

=== Custom repositories

* Not portable
* Hard to consume transitively

=== Maven != Maven Central

* Maven: a build tool
* Maven **repository**: a place where you can find binaries

=== What if there's no repository?

* Source dependencies

[source,groovy]
----
sourceControl {
  vcsMappings {
    gitRepository("git@github.com:orgtst/greeter.git") {
      produceModule("org.test:greeter")
    }
  }
}
----

=== Managing dependencies

=== Typical Maven dependency

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
   <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
   <artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
   <version>3.7</version>
   <scope>compile</scope>
</dependencies>
----

=== Using Gradle

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   // An API dependency is used in public APIS
   api("org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.7")

   // or...
   // An implementation dependency is used in internals
   implementation("org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.7")
}
----

=== API vs implementation

* To _build_ a library, you need:
** API+implementation dependencies
* To _compile_ against a library, you need:
** API dependencies
* To _run_, you need:
** API+implementation+runtime only dependencies

=== Corollary

All libraries published using Maven do it wrong

=== Published metadata

* Should be aimed at _consumers_
* It doesn't matter what you need to compile
* It matters what the _consumers_ need
* Published POM should be != producer POM

=== What Gradle does

* Since 3.4, use the `java-library` plugin
* Maps to `compile` and `runtime` scopes in `pom.xml`
* But it's not enough...

=== Gradle module metadata

* Aimed at modeling properly _variants_ of modules
* Death to classifiers (mostly)
* Model different set of dependencies
* Multi-ecosystem (Java, Native, ...)

=== Consequence

* `all`/`fat` jars published with correct dependencies
* `guava-jdk5`, `guava-jdk7`, ... no longer need to be classifiers
* attributes for matching variants

=== Rich version constraints

=== Meaning of versions

* What does it mean to say: "I depend on 1.1"
* Does it mean it doesn't work using 1.0?
* Implicit statement: "I should work with 1.1+"
* What if it's not true?

=== Meaning of versions

* Use `latest.release`?
* Dependency on `1.2-beta-3`: is `beta` important?
* Dependency on snapshots...

=== Custom dependency reasons

* Explain _why_ a dependency is here

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   implementation("com.google.guava:guava") {
      version { prefer "23" }
      because "required for immutable collections"
   }
}
----

=== Custom dependency reasons

* Shown in dependency insight (soon in build scans)

`gradle dependencyInsight --configuration compileClasspath --dependency guava`

[source,text]
----
org:foo:com.google.guava:guava:23 (required for immutable collections)
   variant "default" [
      Requested attributes not found in the selected variant:
         org.gradle.usage = java-api
   ]
----

=== Strict versions

* Dependency should be **exactly** this version, or _fail_

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   api('com.acme:foo') {
      version {
         strictly '1.1'
      }
      because "Only version approved by QA"
   }
}
----

=== Rejected versions

* Dependency must not be **exactly** this version, or _fail_

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   api('com.acme:foo') {
      version {
         prefer '[1.0, 2.0)'
         reject '1.1'
      }
      because "Version 1.1 has a vulnerability"
   }
}
----

=== Dependency constraints

=== Concept

* Influence versions found in the graph, without adding hard dependencies
* "If you use this module, use this version"

=== dependencyManagement

Similar to Maven's `<dependencyManagement>` block but:

* enforced transitively
* published
* consistent behavior

=== Example 1: dependency version suggestion

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    constraints {
       api 'com.acme:foo:1.0'
    }

    // no need to put a version number
    api 'com.acme:foo'
}
----

=== Example 2: influence transitive dependency version

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    constraints {
       // if 'bar' found transitively, use 1.1
       api 'com.acme:bar:1.1'
    }
    // ...
}
----

=== Constraints publication

* Published as constraints in Gradle metadata
* Published as `<dependencyManagement>` in `pom.xml` (best effort)

=== Component metadata rules: example 1

* Downgrading a dependency

[source,kotlin]
----
withModule(module) {
   allVariants {
      withDependencyConstraints {
         filter { it.group == "org.apache.ivy" }.forEach {
            version { prefer("2.2.0") }
            because("Gradle depends on ivy implementation details which changed with newer versions")
         }
      }
   }
}
----

=== Component metadata rules: example 2

* Remove a dependency

[source,kotlin]
----
withModule("org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit") {
   allVariants {
      withDependencies {
         removeAll { it.group == "com.googlecode.javaewah" }
      }
   }
}
----

=== Further features

* Dependency locking
* Support for platforms
* BOM support
